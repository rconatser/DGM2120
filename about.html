        <p>I was born in Arkansas but raised in Texas. I am one of four children, three boys and one girl - <strong>me</strong>. To say that hasn't affected me would be an understatement. Their love of sci-fi and video games rubbed off onto me when I was quite young. As such, I love sitting behind a computer or being a couch potato, however you have to get out sometime! When I'm outdoors, I can't help but take photos of my surroundings. Especially now, living in Utah, it's just breathtaking.</p>
        
        <p>I moved to Utah after I graduated high school in 2012. That's when my love of photography truly took off. I take photos anywhere I'm outdoors, however I believe it began the moment I went on my first hike - <a href="featured-hikes.html">Lake Blanche</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Experiencing the way the water bounced off the rocks as it made it's way down the mountain, and the way the light hit the autumn leaves just right, still leaves me in awe. It was in these moments looking back at the photos that I realized I made time stand still. I made those emotions and feelings of life stand still.</p>
        
        <p>It's then that I realized, everyone should get to experience this, and that's when I started <strong>Misty Mountain Photography</strong>.</p>

        <h2 class="interiorHeading">The Inspiration Behind the Name</h2>

        <p>Ever since I was little, my family made <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> a big part of my life. The movies, story, and soundtrack leave me with chills pricking at my skin, in the greatest way possible of course. One of my favorite quotes from the movies is:</p>
        
        <blockquote>"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to." <br>- J.R.R. Tolkien</blockquote>
        
        <p>Upon moving out, I kept this in the back of my mind, and still do to this day. It's one of many quotes that I hold dear to my heart. It is this and the tale of Bilbo Baggins in <em>The Hobbit</em> that sparked the inspiration behind the name.</p>
